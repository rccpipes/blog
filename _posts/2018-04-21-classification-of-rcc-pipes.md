At a very broad level, RCC pipes are classified as Pressure pipes (P) and Non-Pressure pipes. Pressure pipes have a hydrostatic pressure rating.

Non-Pressure pipes are used where the fluids are carried by gravity.

| Class | Description | Conditions Where Normally Used |
|:--------|:-------:|--------:|
| NP1   | Unreinforced concrete non-pressure pipes.   | For drainage and irrigation use, above ground or in shallow trenches |
|----
| NP2   | Reinforced concrete, light-duty, non-pressure pipes | For drainage and irrigation use, for cross drains/culverts carrying light traffic  |
|----
| NP3   | Reinforced and also unreinforced (in case of pipes manufactured by vibrated casting process) concrete, medium-duty, non-pressure pipes  | For drainage and irrigation use, for cross drains/culverts carrying medium traffic.   |
|----
| NP4   | Reinforced and also unreinforced (in case of pipes manufactured by vibrated casting process) concrete, heavy-duty, non-pressure pipes   | For drainage and irrigation use, for cross drains/culverts carrying heavy traffic.   |
|----
| P1   | Reinforced concrete pressure pipes tested to a hydrostatic pressure of 0.2 MPa (20 m head)   | For use on gravity mains, the site test pressure not exceeding two-thirds of the hydrostatic test pressure.   |
|----
| P2   | Reinforced concrete pressure pipes tested to a hydrostatic pressure of 0.4 MPa (40 m head)   | For use on gravity mains, the site test pressure not exceeding half of the hydrostatic test pressure. |
|----
| P3   | Reinforced concrete pressure pipes tested to a hydrostatic pressure of 0.6 MPa (60 m head)   | For use on gravity mains, the site test pressure not exceeding half of the hydrostatic test pressure.  |
